# Project Management - React Project

Welcome to the repository of my React Project Management project, where I'm applying everything I've learned about React. This project aims to create a web application that allows users to manage projects, set budgets, and add tasks to those projects.

- Create projects with names, descriptions, and budgets.
- Add tasks to projects, including descriptions and associated costs.
- Track the total project budget, which is automatically updated when new tasks are added.
